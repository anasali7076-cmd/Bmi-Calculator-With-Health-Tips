# BMI Calculator with Health Tips

A Python-based Command Line Interface (CLI) application that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and provides personalized health and diet recommendations based on the results.

## 📌 Features

- **Precise Calculation**: Computes BMI using standard metric units (Weight in Kg, Height in Cm).
- **Health Categorization**: Automatically classifies results into:
  - Underweight
  - Normal weight
  - Overweight
  - Obese
- **Smart Health Tips**: Delivers specific, actionable advice tailored to the user's BMI category (diet, exercise, and lifestyle habits).
- **Input Validation**: Handles errors gracefully (e.g., non-numeric inputs or negative values).
- **OOP Structure**: Built using a modular Class-based approach (`BMI` and `HealthTips` classes) for clean and maintainable code.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- No external libraries are required (uses standard Python libraries).
